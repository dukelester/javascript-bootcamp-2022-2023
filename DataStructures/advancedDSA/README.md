# Searching and Sorting

Searching data and sorting through data are fundamental algorithms. Searching refers to
iterating over the data structure’s elements to retrieve some data. Sorting refers to putting
the data structure’s elements in order. The searching and sorting algorithms are different
for every data structure. We will focus on searching and sorting for arrays.

## Searching

As mentioned, searching is the task of looking for a specific element inside a data
structure. When searching in an array, there are two main techniques depending
on whether the array is sorted. In this section, you’ll learn about linear and binary
searching. Linear searches are especially flexible because they can be used with both
sorted and unsorted data. Binary searches are specifically used with sorted data.
However, a linear search has a higher time complexity than a binary search.
