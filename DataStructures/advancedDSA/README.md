# Searching and Sorting

Searching data and sorting through data are fundamental algorithms. Searching refers to
iterating over the data structure’s elements to retrieve some data. Sorting refers to putting
the data structure’s elements in order. The searching and sorting algorithms are different
for every data structure. We will focus on searching and sorting for arrays.
