// The hash tables
/**
 * A hash table is a fixed-sized data structure in which the size is defined at the start
 * Hash tables are excellent for quick storage and retrieval of data based on key-value pairs.
 * A hash table contains two main functions: put() and get(). put() is used for storing
 * data into the hash table, while get() is used for retrieving data from the hash table. Both
 * of these functions have a time complexity of O(1).
