# JavaScript Datastructures and Algorithms

The Datastructures and algorithms are the methods of storage and set of rules to access data
and carry out data operations.

## The O(n) notation

O(1) => Order 1 the constant time for space and time.
O(n) => Linear
O(n^2) => Quadratic
O(n^3) => cubic

## Rules of Big-O Notation

Let’s represent an algorithm’s complexity as f(n). n represents the number of inputs,
f(n)time represents the time needed, and f(n)space represents the space (additional
memory) needed for the algorithm. The goal of algorithm analysis is to understand the
algorithm’s efficiency by calculating f(n). However, it can be challenging to calculate f(n).
Big-O notation provides some fundamental rules that help developers compute for f(n).

• Coefficient rule: If f(n) is O(g(n)), then kf(n) is O(g(n)), for any
constant k > 0. The first rule is the coefficient rule, which eliminates
coefficients not related to the input size, n. This is because as n
approaches infinity, the other coefficient becomes negligible.

• Sum rule: If f(n) is O(h(n)) and g(n) is O(p(n)), then f(n)+g(n) is
O(h(n)+p(n)). The sum rule simply states that if a resultant time
complexity is a sum of two different time complexities, the resultant
Big-O notation is also the sum of two different Big-O notations.

• Product rule: If f(n) is O(h(n)) and g(n) is O(p(n)), then f(n)g(n) is
O(h(n)p(n)). Similarly, the product rule states that Big-O is multiplied
when the time complexities are multiplied.
• Transitive rule: If f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(h(n)), then f(n) is
O(h(n)). The transitive rule is a simple way to state that the same time
complexity has the same Big-O.

• Polynomial rule: If f(n) is a polynomial of degree k, then f(n) is
O(nk). Intuitively, the polynomial rule states that polynomial time
complexities have Big-O of the same polynomial degree.

• Log of a power rule: log(nk) is O(log(n)) for any constant k > 0. With
the log of a power rule, constants within a log function are also
ignored in Big-O notation.
